		     README for CUDA-GDB release

This is CUDA-GDB, the NVIDIA CUDA source-level debugger for Linux and Mac OS,
based on GDB-14.2, the GNU source-level debugger.

For more information about gdb, please refer to README file in this folder or
check the GDB home page at http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb

CUDA-GDB BUILD INSTRUCTIONS (example only, adjust as needed)
===========================

First, make sure that libtermcap and other required dependent packages are
installed (try sudo yum install ncurses-devel). The configure command will
issue an error if some packages are missing.

Please note that the libexpat development headers must be present if CUDA-GDB
is to be used for cross-platform debugging.

Issue the following commands to build CUDA-GDB:
    ./configure --program-prefix=cuda- \
        --enable-cuda \
        --enable-targets="x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu,\
        arm-elf-linux-gnu,m68k-unknown-linux-gnu" \
        CFLAGS='-I/usr/local/cuda/include' \
        LDFLAGS='-lpthread'
    make

USING CUDA-GDB
==============
All standard GDB commands could be used both for CPU and GPU code debugging.
In addition to that, CUDA-GDB provides CUDA-specific command families like 
"info cuda ..." to query GPU states, "cuda .." to control debugger focus on
GPU and "[get|set] cuda .." to alter/query CUDA debugger configuration.
